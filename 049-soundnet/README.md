### Note
The `soundnet_prelivestream.py` version was created a few days before the
livestream just to make sure everything works. That's the complete version
with TUN enabled (i.e. can be used for TCP/IP connections). The
`soundnet_livestream.py` on the other hand was created during the livestream
and isn't complete - the TUN part is missing.
